/*
  * Project: SSH Key Deploy Script 
  * Description:  
  *		script to simplify mangement of the authorized_keys file
  *		- copy any .pub files which should be included into ./active/
  *		- copy any .pub files which should be removed into ./remove/
  *
  *		works great in combination with git. fork or copy the files into your own git repository
  *		and add the public files to git. this makes it easy to deploy your ssh keys accross multiple
  *		servers. this could even be used with a cronjob to rebuild your authorized_keys automatically
